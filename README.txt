I forgot to initally create a repo for this one... but the project is complete!

Like my last assignment, this has only been tested in IntelliJ.
The run configurations are pretty basic.
In edit configurations, both should have the main class set to sample.Main
Set the working directries accordingly (find the folder marked client/server).
Other than that, it should be good to go!

The main thing to take note of is the 2 folders: Local Files for client and Server Files for the server.
These 2 folders hold the files that the client and server have respectibly.
If you want to use your own text files (I've only tested it with .txt files), please put them in those folders.
